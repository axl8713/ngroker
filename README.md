# ngroker
An attempt to create a Telegram bot that remotely opens ngrok tunnels. 

With this bot, one can ask for a HTTP or TCP tunnel to be opened on a machine where <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> is installed.

While this project has been created for my needs, it is mainly developed as a weekend project to learn coding in Python.
